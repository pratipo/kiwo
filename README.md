###Overview
Kiwo is an augmented rag loom, an artifact for hybrid fabric manufacture. It's a digital, interactive loom that can manage complex patterns in a user-friendly way. 

An augmented loom is not an elektroknit machine (a fully automated robot into which you feed a pattern and it takes over both the act of producing and the product), nor a traditional loom that gives no feedback to the user. Kiwo is a prototype designed to preserve all the properties of the craft production activity (inherent to the product and the social, physical and emotional activity itself) while speeding up the ability to learn new stitches and transform the number of patterns created or shared into tangible fabrics.

Using a series of simple sensors and actuators Kiwo is able to read the user's work and guide how fabrics are made out of different stitches. Multi-coloured patterns can be made too, by using several strands of colour to produce pictures, motifs and symbols. These complex patterns can be computer generated and easily transferred to the artefact (previously or) after they have been (self)made or distributed.  

A mobile app allows users to transfer these patterns into Kiwo, while enjoying outdoor and social life.
